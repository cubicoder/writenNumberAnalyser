## overall grammar
hundred + " " + decadic + "-" + number

## general lists
*{} : irregular*
* number: "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"
* decadic: {"ten"}, {"twenty"}, {"thirty"}, {"forty"}, {"fifty"}, "sixty", "seventy", {"eighty"}, "ninety"

## numbers
Since english is a pretty nice language, we don't have any bigger problems facing single digit numbers.

## decadics
Here things are getting a bit mor camplicated. When you look at the list of decadic numbers you notice, that some of them follow a certain rule:

decadic = number + "ty"

Unfortunatly, this is only true for 3 out of 10 decadics(60,70,90), others are differing slightly by taking another variant of the stem(20,30,40,50,80) and one of them is compleatly out of the ordinairy(10).

## decadics + numbers
When merging the two together all the numbers comming out seem to follow the rule

decadic + "-" + number

as described above in *overall grammar*.
But the numbers in combination with ten follow a different rule:

number + "teen"

Again this rule is only complitly respected by some few members(14,16,17,19), the rest is once again taking another stem(13,15,18) or is doing something completly random(11,12)
